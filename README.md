# Lab 4: MAGNificent
*Lab4_frdmmcxa153_lpi2c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master*

In this Lab we will end up in porting the available firmware to control the NMH1000 Magnetic
sensor to our FRDM-MCXA153 board. We will first start with an I2C communication example
included in the SDK which provides a very good starting point, and we will go through some
steps to modify it and adapt it to control the NMH1000 sensor. Then, we will test the full
project onto a MIKROE click board which can be easily connected to out FRDM-MCXA153
board through the MIKRO bus socket
